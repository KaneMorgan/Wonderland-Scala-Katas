## How to Do the Katas

First, clone or fork this repo. Each of the katas are in their own
directory and are self contained Clojure leiningen projects.  You `cd`
into the project and run `lein test` to show the failing tests, then
complete the code to make the tests pass. Each project has the
instructions in its own _README.md_ file.

If you don't have Leiningen installed yet.  Follow these [instructions](http://leiningen.org/)
to get it.

For example, to get started on the _alphabet-cipher_ kata first.

1. Clone or Fork this repo
2. run `sbt AlphabetCipher`
3. Check out the alphabet cipher instructions in AlphabetCipher/README.md.
4. Add the code in the source files to make the tests pass.
