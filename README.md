>“Curiouser and curiouser!” -- ― Lewis Carroll, Alice in Wonderland

## How to Do the Katas

First, clone or fork this repo. Each of the katas are in their own directory and are self contained Scala sbt proects.  You can run `sbt <folder name>` to show the failing tests, then complete the code to make the tests pass. Each project has the instructions in its own _README.md_ file.

For example, to get started on the _alphabet-cipher_ kata first.

1. Clone or Fork this repo
2. run `sbt AlphabetCipher`
3. Check out the alphabet cipher instructions in AlphabetCipher/README.md.
4. Add the code in the source files to make the tests pass.
